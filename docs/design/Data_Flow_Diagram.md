# UniCircle data flow diagrams (DFD)

Status: **logical design**, based on the [HLD](HLD.md), [LLD](LLD.md), and [ERD](ERD.md). Rounded nodes are processing functions, cylinders are persistent stores, and rectangles are external people/systems. Arrows label data, not authorization grants. The browser-to-Next.js BFF hop is inside the UniCircle boundary; FastAPI is the final data-authorization boundary.

## Level 0 — context

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Visitor[Visitor] -->|public page request, registration or login form| System([UniCircle web application])
    Member[General User] -->|feature queries, posts, requests, event forms, questions| System
    AppAdmin[App Admin] -->|transport, news, club decisions, moderation| System
    ClubAdmin[Student Club Admin] -->|club and event changes| System
    System -->|public Home, auth result| Visitor
    System -->|scoped pages, status, notifications, answers| Member
    System -->|review queues and action results| AppAdmin
    System -->|own-club data and registration review| ClubAdmin
    System -->|OTP email request| SMTP[SMTP provider]
    Sources[Approved CUET sites] -->|published campus text and metadata| System
    System -->|bounded question plus retrieved evidence| OpenAI[OpenAI API]
    OpenAI -->|candidate answer| System
```

No user password, OTP, JWT, private chat, registration record, or bKash transaction ID is sent to OpenAI. The SMTP provider receives only the verification recipient, code, and basic email content. The frontend never sends a user-supplied role, owner ID, or club-admin flag as authority.

## Level 1 — primary processes and data stores

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    User[General User] -->|account forms| Auth([1. Auth and profile])
    User -->|browse query| Campus([2. Campus reads])
    User -->|club, event, request data| Clubs([3. Clubs and events])
    User -->|resource, chat, forum data| Community([4. Community])
    User -->|questions, notification actions| Assist([7. Assistant and notifications])
    Admin[App Admin] -->|review and publication commands| AdminWork([5. Admin operations])
    ClubAdmin[Student Club Admin] -->|own-club management| Clubs
    Worker[Scheduled worker] -->|event time and outbox claims| Delivery([6. Delivery jobs])
    Site[Approved CUET sites] -->|allowlisted pages| Ingest([8. Source ingestion])

    Auth <-->|accounts, OTP digests, session state| D1[(D1 Identity)]
    Campus <-->|departments, faculty, locations, transport| D2[(D2 Campus, transport, news)]
    Clubs <-->|clubs, events, registrations| D3[(D3 Clubs and events)]
    Community <-->|requests, messages, posts, reports| D4[(D4 Community)]
    AdminWork <-->|transport, news, reviews| D2
    AdminWork <-->|club decisions| D3
    AdminWork <-->|moderation| D4
    AdminWork -->|published update or announcement| D5[(D5 Outbox and notifications)]
    D3 -->|event start and end times| Delivery
    Delivery <-->|pending jobs and delivered notices| D5
    Assist <-->|own notification rows and read marks| D5
    Assist <-->|approved sources and chunks| D6[(D6 RAG metadata and vector index)]
    Ingest -->|source metadata and approved chunks| D6

    Auth -->|OTP delivery| Mail[SMTP]
    Assist -->|retrieved evidence and question| Model[OpenAI]
    Model -->|candidate text| Assist

    Auth -->|auth result| User
    Campus -->|campus DTOs| User
    Clubs -->|public counts and own state| User
    Community -->|participant-scoped data| User
    Assist -->|notifications or grounded answer| User
```

`D1`–`D5` are logical areas of the same PostgreSQL database, not separate deployed databases. `D6` combines PostgreSQL source metadata with a vector index whose product is still unselected. The delivery worker is a planned process; current backend code has only a notification service foundation. Access to every store is mediated by services/repositories rather than direct browser queries.

## Level 2 — account registration and verification

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Applicant[CUET applicant] -->|registration fields| BFF([Next.js auth adapter])
    BFF -->|validated payload| Register([Register pending account])
    Register -->|hash and save| Users[(User records)]
    Register -->|email and purpose| Issue([Issue OTP])
    Issue -->|keyed digest, expiry, attempts| Challenges[(OTP challenge)]
    Issue -->|code and recipient| SMTP[SMTP]
    Applicant -->|email and received code| BFF
    BFF -->|verification payload| Verify([Check and consume OTP])
    Verify <-->|locked challenge| Challenges
    Verify -->|verified timestamp| Users
    BFF -->|username/email and password| Login([Authenticate and create session])
    Login <-->|current user and password hash| Users
    Login -->|jti digest and expiry| Sessions[(Auth sessions)]
    Login -->|short-lived JWT for server cookie| BFF
    BFF -->|safe session user, HttpOnly cookie| Applicant
```

The application does not send an access token after registration or OTP issuance. Password plaintext exists only in the inbound request long enough to verify/hash it. The OTP challenge stores a digest; the code is delivered by email only. OTP verification and `verified_at` update must be atomic. Login reads current account state and writes an active session. See the [authentication sequence](Sequence_Diagram.md#registration-verification-and-login) for ordering, retries, and failure branches.

## DFD balancing and privacy checks

- Level 1 inputs/outputs are subsets of Level 0: visitors/users/Admins provide forms and commands; UniCircle returns scoped views/results; SMTP, CUET sites, and OpenAI are the only external data collaborators shown.
- The document [flow diagram](Document_Flow_Diagram.md) tracks individual forms and review records; it should not be read as a second database design.
- The notification list is owner-scoped, conversation data is participant-scoped, and event-registration rows are limited to the registrant and that club's admins. Data minimization belongs in response DTOs, not just frontend hiding.
- App Admin operations pass through FastAPI authorization even if an Admin-only page is hidden from General Users. No direct `D1`–`D6` browser access exists.
