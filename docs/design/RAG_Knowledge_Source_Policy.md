# RAG knowledge-source policy

## Default: reviewed local knowledge

The 2026-10-08 requirement replaces whole-site scraping as the runtime corpus.
`backend/app/modules/assistant/knowledge/CUET_Knowledge_Base.md` is authoritative;
the `.txt` file is its deterministic plain-text companion. Both ship with the
backend. Ingestion validates consistency and never indexes both copies.

The independently written summary contains stable section IDs, factual text,
public evidence URLs, review dates and review-after dates. Sources include CUET
documents, government institutional information, QS/THE/EduRank's own tables,
dated reputable reporting, and attributed OpenStreetMap-derived campus markers.
Community food listings establish cafeteria identity, not verified prices or
opening hours. Map positions are approximate, not navigation guarantees.
Prototype pages and old summaries are cross-checked; navigation-only extraction
cannot establish academic or personnel counts.

Rankings identify publisher and edition. Current appointments take precedence
over old biographies. Historical pro-VC appointments are not current appointments;
inability to identify a holder does not prove vacancy. No dummy names, fabricated
phones, unverified room directions, live admission dates or invented teacher
headcounts belong in this corpus.

## Ingestion and refresh

Run `python -m app.modules.assistant.ingest --check` to validate files without
database/model access. After editing Markdown, use `--export-txt` in a writable
checkout, review the companion, and run ingestion without crawler flags.
In Docker, rebuild the backend image after editing the corpus and run the
existing ingestion command inside the backend container.

LangChain splits each section independently; chunks repeat their topic and
as-of date. Ollama embeds with the configured model; chunks and evidence metadata
are stored in PostgreSQL. All vectors are prepared and validated before an
atomic commit. Provider failures cannot remove the last good index. Unchanged
sections skip embedding; model changes and `--force` rebuild vectors.

Re-verify leadership weekly, rankings monthly, and campus/academic facts on their
recorded quarterly/half-yearly dates. Ingestion updates index time, not research
validity. Update review dates only after checking evidence. Unknown administrative
appointments should be confirmed with the Registrar.

## Retrieval and privacy

`RAG_KNOWLEDGE_MODE=curated` is the default. Retrieve only local sources whose
corpus hash matches the bundled document, pipeline version and embedding model
match, and review period includes today in Bangladesh time. Legacy website rows
remain stored for recovery but cannot contaminate curated answers. Removed
sections and old snapshots are excluded. Expired sections produce a no-context
answer rather than a stale current appointment. Admin knowledge status counts
eligible sources/chunks and reports review-due sections.

Cosine similarity ranks a bounded corpus; low-scoring chunks are not sent to Qwen.
Retrieved content remains untrusted data, never instructions or authority.
The prompt respects dates and uncertainty. Evidence URLs stay in files/database
for maintenance; answers return no source cards, URLs or citation markers.
Audits store a question hash, user ID, outcome, source count and timestamp,
not raw questions or conversations. Ollama stays backend-only.

## Optional legacy crawler

`--web` explicitly invokes the strict approved-host HTTPS crawler with robots
checks, throttling, page/depth/download limits, `WebBaseLoader` for HTML and
`PyPDFLoader` for PDFs. Adding a host requires review; portals, assets and unrelated
sources remain blocked. Web results enter retrieval only if an operator
deliberately selects `RAG_KNOWLEDGE_MODE=web`. Manually consulting external
evidence does not expand that crawler allowlist. There is no scraping or online
research inside a question request.

## Verification boundary

Deterministic-provider tests cover local loading, file parity, grounding
contracts, old-source exclusion, review expiry, corpus/model compatibility,
idempotency and failure preservation. Live answer quality requires both configured
model tags and real embeddings. At this implementation check the local Ollama
`/api/tags` returned no models; live index rebuilding remains a pending acceptance
step, not a claimed pass.
