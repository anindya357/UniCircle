# UniCircle low-level design (LLD)

Status: **planned Phase 7 contracts and invariants**. Authentication and
`PATCH /users/me` are implemented in migration `20260921_0002` and the FastAPI
auth/profile routers; other feature routes below remain proposed. The
[ERD](ERD.md) defines storage and the [HLD](HLD.md) defines runtime boundaries.

## Standard request path

```text
Browser → same-origin Next.js BFF → FastAPI router → Pydantic schema
        → current-user/session dependency → feature permission check
        → service transaction → repository/SQLAlchemy → PostgreSQL
        → response DTO → BFF → browser
```

FastAPI retains `/api/v1`. Successful JSON uses `{ "data": ... }`; errors use `{ "error": { "code", "message", "details"? } }`. List data uses `{ "items", "total", "limit", "offset" }` inside `data`, with bounded `limit` (currently 1–100). UUIDs are serialized as strings, datetimes as UTC ISO 8601, and money as integer minor units. Use `201` for created resources, `204` for completed actions with no body, `400/422` for malformed requests, `401` for missing/invalid authentication, `403` for a known forbidden action, `404` for absent or deliberately concealed objects, `409` for uniqueness/state conflicts, `429` for throttling, and `503` for unavailable dependencies. Do not put user-entered secrets into error details.

The BFF uses allowlisted feature handlers or a strictly allowlisted gateway, never an unrestricted URL proxy. Server Components can call FastAPI server-to-server; interactive client components use same-origin BFF endpoints. Next.js `proxy.ts` may redirect optimistically, but each protected page's server data loader and each FastAPI endpoint must verify access. Server-side feature adapters replace mock services one module at a time. Next.js [authentication](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/authentication) and [BFF](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/backend-for-frontend) guidance inform this boundary.

## Authentication and profile module

### Data and service methods

`UserRepository` handles case-insensitive identifier lookup, uniqueness, account insertion, verification, and profile updates. `OtpStore` implements the existing atomic challenge protocol. `AuthSessionRepository` stores a digest of random JWT `jti`, expiry, and revocation. A `get_current_user` dependency verifies signature/claims, finds an active session, then loads the **current** active and verified user. `get_current_admin` checks current `role=admin`; `require_club_admin(club_id)` checks a student mapping in `CLUB_ADMIN` at mutation time. Neither permission is inferred from frontend state or token claims.

Registration validates CUET email, role (`student|teacher|staff`), role-specific university ID, names/address, username, and password. Insert the pending account with Argon2 hash in one transaction; database unique constraints resolve races after pre-checks. Issue an OTP with cryptographically random code, keyed digest, expiry, resend cooldown, and attempt limit. SMTP is an external side effect: commit the pending account first, persist challenge, send, and discard that challenge if delivery fails; the pending account can retry. Never return or log the code. OTP verification locks the challenge and user, consumes the challenge once, and sets `verified_at` atomically. Expired, consumed, or exhausted challenges cannot activate the account.

General login accepts username or CUET email and a password. Admin login accepts only the provisioned Admin ID/password. Return the same generic credential error for missing accounts, wrong password, inactive accounts, and unverified accounts; avoid account enumeration. Apply rate limits by account identifier and client network identity. On success, create a session row and JWT with the same random `jti`. The Next.js BFF sets a host-only HttpOnly cookie; it returns a safe user DTO, not the token, to client code. Version 1 has no refresh token; expiry requires login again. Logout revokes the session and clears the cookie. Only a restricted one-time CLI provisions an Admin; no default Admin account or public Admin registration exists. See the [authentication sequence](Sequence_Diagram.md#registration-verification-and-login).

The current frontend `SessionUser` assumes every account has CUET email, username, and university ID. The ERD allows an Admin without those General User fields, so integration must use a discriminated General-User/Admin session DTO (or separate admin DTO); do not fabricate values for an Admin.

### Planned endpoints

| FastAPI route | Access | Main effect/result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST /auth/register` | Public, rate-limited | Pending General User, return email only; no login token |
| `POST /auth/verify-otp` | Public, rate-limited | Consume valid OTP and verify account |
| `POST /auth/resend-otp` | Public, rate-limited | Generic acknowledgement; resend only when eligible |
| `POST /auth/login` | Public, rate-limited | General User JWT/session for BFF only |
| `POST /auth/admin/login` | Public, rate-limited | Provisioned App Admin JWT/session for BFF only |
| `GET /auth/me` | Authenticated | Safe current-user DTO from live account |
| `POST /auth/logout` | Authenticated | Revoke current session |
| `PATCH /users/me` | Authenticated | Update allowed profile fields; no role/ID/verification edits |

## Feature module boundaries and routes

The table lists a compact API surface, not a promise to build all endpoints at once. All IDs are validated UUIDs; user IDs for owner-scoped actions come from the session, **not** request bodies. `U` means verified General User, `S` student, `C` mapped admin of the specified club, and `A` App Admin. Public Home is static and has no content API for now.

| Module | Proposed FastAPI routes | Access and response rule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Directory | `GET /departments`, `GET /departments/{code}`, `GET /departments/{code}/faculty`, `GET /faculty/{id}`, `GET /faculty/{id}/profile` | U; 12 seeded department codes; profile details fetched from CUET on demand with a public-field allowlist and saved-listing fallback |
| Campus explorer | `GET /campus-locations`, `GET /campus-locations/{id}` | U; public asset/map references only |
| Clubs | `GET /clubs`, `GET /clubs/{id}`, `GET /clubs/{id}/events` | U; no private member/admin IDs in public list DTO |
| Club requests | `POST /club-requests`, `GET /club-requests/mine` | S; request owner from session |
| Club governance | `GET /admin/club-requests`, `POST /admin/club-requests/{id}/decision` | A; decision exactly once, transactional |
| Club management | `PATCH /clubs/{id}`, `GET/POST /clubs/{id}/admins`, `DELETE /clubs/{id}/admins/{user_id}` | C; target of admin addition must be a registered student; never remove final admin |
| Events | `GET /events?status=`, `GET /events/{id}`, `POST /clubs/{id}/events`, `PATCH /events/{id}`, `DELETE /events/{id}` | Reads U, writes C for event's club; status derived from time |
| Event participation | `PUT /events/{id}/interest`, `POST /events/{id}/registrations`, `GET /events/{id}/registrations/mine` | U for interest, S for registration; one row per user/event |
| Event registration review | `GET /clubs/{id}/events/{event_id}/registrations`, `PATCH /clubs/{id}/events/{event_id}/registrations/{registration_id}/payment` | C; private participant and bKash data |
| Resource discovery | `GET /users/discover`, `GET /resource-profile/me`, `PATCH /resource-profile/me` | U; no home address or private contact in discovery |
| Resource requests | `POST /resource-requests`, `GET /resource-requests/mine`, `POST /resource-requests/{id}/decision` | U; only recipient accepts/rejects; no self-request |
| Chat | `GET /conversations`, `GET /conversations/{id}/messages`, `POST /conversations/{id}/messages` | U and a participant in the accepted request; bounded history |
| Transport | `GET /transport/schedules?date=`, `GET /transport/schedules/{id}`, `GET /transport/drivers`, `GET /transport/routes` | U; reject or omit past schedules, depending on endpoint contract |
| Transport management | `POST /admin/transport/schedules`, `PATCH/DELETE /admin/transport/schedules/{id}`; corresponding `/buses`, `/drivers`, `/routes` | A; recurrence expands to dated schedules in a bounded series |
| Forum | `GET /forum/posts`, `POST /forum/posts`, `GET /forum/posts/{id}`, `GET/POST /forum/posts/{id}/comments`, `POST /forum/posts/{id}/reports` | U; text only, paginated feed, report once per user/post |
| Forum moderation | `GET /admin/forum/reports`, `POST /admin/forum/reports/{id}/decision` | A; soft-delete reported post or resolve report |
| News | `GET /news`, `GET /news/{id}` | U; published items only, newest first |
| News management | `POST /admin/news`, `PATCH/DELETE /admin/news/{id}`, `POST /admin/news/{id}/publish` | A; update/announcement publication and outbox entry in one transaction |
| Notifications | `GET /notifications`, `PATCH /notifications/{id}/read`, `POST /notifications/read-all` | U; own rows only, unread/read timestamps |
| Assistant | `POST /assistant/questions` | U; bounded question, grounded answer/status/sources; rate-limited |

Implementation must define exact Pydantic request/response schemas before each route is added. Do not expose the mock-only aggregate snapshots directly: `ClubEventSnapshot`, `ResourceSharingSnapshot`, `ForumSnapshot`, `TransportSnapshot`, and `AdminSnapshot` currently bundle unrelated private and public data. The frontend service adapters should compose their screens from scoped, paginated real endpoints instead. The mock `mutualConnections` field has no data source and is omitted from the live resource-discovery DTO.

## State transitions and transaction boundaries

| State machine | Allowed transition | Transaction invariant |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Account | pending → verified; active → inactive | OTP single-use and `verified_at` change commit together; no login while pending/inactive |
| Club request | pending → approved or rejected | Lock pending row; approval creates one club and initial student admin atomically; retries return existing result |
| Club admin membership | add/remove | Validate student identity; lock club membership set and refuse removal of final admin |
| Event interest | none ↔ interested ↔ going | Upsert one `(event_id,user_id)` row; not a registration |
| Event registration | absent → submitted | Check future/open event, mode, student identity, uniqueness; paid submission starts `pending_review` |
| Paid registration | pending_review → confirmed or rejected | Only that club's admin may review; never infer payment from transaction ID alone |
| Resource request | pending → accepted or rejected | Only recipient decides; accept creates at most one conversation in the same transaction |
| Forum report | open → resolved or post_removed | Only App Admin; removal soft-deletes post and hides comments in reads |
| News | draft → published | Publish timestamp and outbox event commit together; only published news is visible |
| Notification | unread → read | Owner-scoped update; repeated mark-as-read is idempotent |

Event `upcoming/ongoing/finished` is derived from UTC start/end times, not manually edited. `attendeeCount` counts Going interest rows; `registeredCount` counts submitted registrations, including paid submissions awaiting review. A worker detects start/end boundaries and writes idempotent outbox events. Outbox consumers claim work safely across processes, create notification rows with unique `(recipient_id,dedupe_key)`, and retry failures without duplicating user-visible notices. The job runner and polling interval will be selected when notifications are implemented; no in-process development timer should be mistaken for durable production scheduling.

## Feature-specific implementation notes

- **Directory/Explorer:** seed the 12 approved departments and current known faculty/location content through idempotent development data. Do not manufacture missing phone/email values. Home stays static with CUET media assets unless the product owner later requests CMS management.
- **Clubs/Events:** public club DTOs include name, short name, category, tagline, activities, and event counts. Return `canManage` or an admin-specific view only after permission lookup. Convert the frontend's fee display to integer paisa at the API boundary. Free/paid event registration and Interest/Going are independent. The club request form must add campus need and expected impact to match the ERD.
- **Resources/Chat:** discovery exposes only opted-in resource-profile fields. Current mock's all-messages snapshot must become owner-scoped conversation pages. REST with refresh/polling is the initial chat transport; WebSocket/realtime is deferred until justified. No claim of cryptographic E2EE.
- **Transport:** keep a dated four-window schedule and route variants. Recurrent Admin input materializes a bounded date range with a shared series ID; edits/deletes must specify one occurrence or the whole future series. Reject double-booked bus/driver assignments. Public queries do not reveal past dates.
- **Forum/News:** text-only posts/comments. News categories are `news`, `update`, `announcement`; only published items enter the public list. Private report details stay in Admin APIs. Announcements/updates generate idempotent notification jobs.
- **Assistant/RAG:** crawl only explicitly allowlisted public CUET HTTPS hosts, extract HTML/PDF content with LangChain, and persist source metadata plus `text-embedding-3-small` vectors in PostgreSQL JSON. The bounded service ranks at most 10,000 chunks by cosine similarity, returns a no-context result below threshold, and cites deduplicated sources. Retrieved text is untrusted data, never an instruction or source of API permissions. See the [source policy](RAG_Knowledge_Source_Policy.md) and [RAG sequence](Sequence_Diagram.md#campus-assistant-query).

## Verification gates for each feature

Review the ERD slice and migration, test constraints with PostgreSQL, test service transitions and forbidden access, generate/check OpenAPI, adapt the corresponding frontend service, then run its browser journey. Do not mark a feature complete because its mock screen already looks finished. The complete project testing phases remain in the [feature plan](../../UniCircle_Feature_Wise_Implementation_TODO.md).
