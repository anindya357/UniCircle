# UniCircle use-case diagrams

Status: **planned behavior and permissions**. These Mermaid actor-to-use-case views use oval nodes for use cases so they render in the repository; they are UML-style rather than an executable permission policy. Server-side authorization rules are specified in the [LLD](LLD.md) and enforced later in FastAPI.

## Visitor and General User cases

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Visitor[Visitor]
    General[Verified General User]
    Student[Student]

    subgraph System[UniCircle]
        Home([View public CUET Home])
        Register([Register CUET account])
        Verify([Verify email with OTP])
        Login([Log in and log out])
        Campus([Browse directory and campus locations])
        Clubs([Browse clubs and events])
        Interest([Set Interested or Going])
        Transport([View current or future transport])
        Community([Post, comment, report, request resources, chat])
        News([Read news and notifications])
        Assistant([Ask campus assistant])
        Profile([View and edit own profile])
        ClubRequest([Request a new club])
        EventRegister([Register for enabled event])
    end

    Visitor --> Home
    Visitor --> Register
    Visitor --> Verify
    Visitor --> Login
    General --> Home
    General --> Login
    General --> Campus
    General --> Clubs
    General --> Interest
    General --> Transport
    General --> Community
    General --> News
    General --> Assistant
    General --> Profile
    Student --> ClubRequest
    Student --> EventRegister
    Student -.->|inherits general access| General
```

`General User` means a verified, active student, teacher, or staff account. `Student` specializes that actor for student-only club requests and event registration. Resource requests and chat are only between authorized participants; acceptance is required before chat. Other feature pages are unavailable to a visitor even though Home remains public.

## Club Admin and App Admin cases

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    ClubAdmin[Student mapped to this club]
    AppAdmin[Provisioned App Admin]

    subgraph System[UniCircle protected management]
        EditClub([Edit own club details])
        ClubAdmins([Add or remove student admins])
        Events([Create, edit, or delete club events])
        Payments([Review paid event registrations])
        ReviewClub([Approve or reject club requests])
        ManageTransport([Maintain buses, routes, drivers, schedules])
        ManageNews([Draft and publish news or announcements])
        Moderate([Review reports and remove inappropriate posts])
        AdminLogin([Log in with special Admin ID])
    end

    ClubAdmin --> EditClub
    ClubAdmin --> ClubAdmins
    ClubAdmin --> Events
    ClubAdmin --> Payments
    AppAdmin --> AdminLogin
    AppAdmin --> ReviewClub
    AppAdmin --> ManageTransport
    AppAdmin --> ManageNews
    AppAdmin --> Moderate
```

Club Admin is a **per-club student membership**, not a global login role. A student who administers Club A has no write permission for Club B unless separately mapped. App Admin does not automatically become a club admin and does not use public registration. App Admin's central privileges are limited to the areas assigned by the workflow, not every entity in the ERD.

## External collaborators and automated cases

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    SMTP[SMTP provider]
    Worker[Scheduled notification worker]
    CUET[Approved CUET websites]
    OpenAI[OpenAI API]

    subgraph System[UniCircle automated cases]
        DeliverOtp([Deliver email verification code])
        Notify([Fan out event and announcement notices])
        Ingest([Ingest approved campus sources])
        Answer([Generate grounded answer with citations])
    end

    SMTP --> DeliverOtp
    Worker --> Notify
    CUET --> Ingest
    OpenAI --> Answer
    Ingest -. provides_evidence .-> Answer
```

External collaborators do not receive broad application permissions. SMTP receives only a verification message. The scheduled worker acts on durable outbox/schedule state and uses idempotency. Approved CUET sites supply source material; OpenAI receives a bounded question plus retrieved evidence, not account secrets or private data.

## Use-case conditions

| Use case | Required condition | Failure/alternative |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Verify email | Valid, unexpired, unused OTP for a pending CUET account | Invalid/expired/attempt-exhausted code is rejected; resend has cooldown |
| Log in | Correct credentials, verified and active account | Generic credential error; no Admin self-registration |
| Request club | Authenticated student | Pending request remains private until approved |
| Manage club/event | Student mapped to the target club | Other club's mutation denied; final admin cannot be removed |
| Register for event | Authenticated student, event registration enabled and open | One registration per user/event; paid claim requires transaction ID and review |
| Chat | Participant in an accepted resource request | Pending/rejected or unrelated conversation denied |
| Admin review/publish/moderate | Provisioned App Admin with current active session | Normal users and Club Admins denied |
| Ask assistant | Authenticated user, allowed question and quota | No relevant context returns `not-found`; provider failure returns safe error |

Detailed ordering is shown in the [sequence diagrams](Sequence_Diagram.md); records are shown in the [ERD](ERD.md).
