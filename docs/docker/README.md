# UniCircle Docker setup — Phase 10

Run commands from the repository root with Docker Desktop in Linux-container
mode. Docker's data remains in the previously configured D-drive location.
`compose.yaml` runs the production frontend/backend images and PostgreSQL on
isolated networks, with a one-shot migration job before the API starts. This is
local integration and production preparation, not a production deployment.

## Start the complete stack from a clean clone

Docker Compose 2.24.4+ (or newer Docker Desktop) is required for the production
overlay's `!reset` tag. No host Python/Node installation is needed to build/run
the application images. From the repository root:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.compose.example .env.compose
```

Only copy on first setup; do not overwrite an existing configured file. Edit
`.env.compose`: generate distinct random database/JWT/OTP secrets and supply valid
SMTP settings. You can reuse your configured SMTP provider, but never commit its
password. Use a URI-safe local database password or provide a URL-encoded
`DOCKER_DATABASE_URL` with host `postgres:5432`. Placeholders intentionally cannot
start the production API. Existing native `.env` files are not changed or copied
into images. Do not print expanded `docker compose config` containing secrets;
use `config --quiet` for validation.

Build with a committed source revision and start:

```powershell
$env:IMAGE_TAG = (git rev-parse --short=12 HEAD).Trim()
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/build_docker.ps1
docker compose --env-file .env.compose up --detach --no-build --wait
docker compose --env-file .env.compose ps --all
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` (or the configured `FRONTEND_PORT`). Chromium/Edge
supports Secure cookies on HTTP loopback for local testing; deployed sessions
require HTTPS. Do not switch cookie security off for Docker. Backend and frontend
remain in production mode, with no development reload servers.

The shared app network connects frontend → `http://backend:8000`. A separate
internal database network connects backend/migrate → `postgres:5432`; the
frontend is not on that network. No backend host port is published. PostgreSQL
waits for health, `migrate` waits for authenticated readiness and applies Alembic
head, backend waits for successful migration, then frontend waits for backend
health. A failed migration prevents API startup. Migration history is kept in the
database. Back up a populated DB before upgrades; restarting is not a rollback.

This Docker DB is separate from the existing native application DB. Existing
accounts, club-admin mappings, messages, and RAG corpus are **not** imported
automatically. Register users against the new stack, or separately plan a
reviewed backup/restore. No default Admin password or test accounts are seeded by
normal startup. Campus starter content is explicitly seeded using existing CLIs:

```powershell
docker compose --env-file .env.compose exec backend python -m app.modules.directory.seed
docker compose --env-file .env.compose exec backend python -m app.modules.campus.seed
docker compose --env-file .env.compose exec backend python -m app.modules.transport.seed
docker compose --env-file .env.compose exec backend python -m app.modules.auth.provision_admin --admin-id YOUR_ADMIN_ID
```

After a verified student exists, select that student's UUID explicitly when
bootstrapping clubs:

```powershell
docker compose --env-file .env.compose exec backend python -m app.modules.clubs.seed --student-id STUDENT_UUID
```

Ollama stays in the existing E-drive host installation. The backend-only
`OLLAMA_BASE_URL` defaults to `http://host.docker.internal:11434` on Docker Desktop;
verify model-service/firewall reachability without exposing it publicly. Linux
hosts need an explicitly reachable private model endpoint. Do not move/download
models into app images. The new DB needs explicit knowledge ingestion before
grounded answers are available:

```powershell
docker compose --env-file .env.compose exec backend python -m app.modules.assistant.ingest
```

The approved event-notification command can be scheduled externally with
`docker compose --env-file .env.compose exec -T backend python -m app.modules.clubs.notifications`.
No extra in-process scheduler or unnecessary infrastructure is introduced.

Inspect logs and API liveness without publishing the backend:

```powershell
docker compose --env-file .env.compose logs --tail 100 backend migrate frontend
docker compose --env-file .env.compose exec backend python -c "import urllib.request; print(urllib.request.urlopen('http://127.0.0.1:8000/health').status)"
```

Stop with `docker compose --env-file .env.compose down`; the database volume
survives. Never add `--volumes` for normal shutdown. To rebuild changed code,
commit it, build its new image tag, then recreate the stack with the same volume.
Uncommitted builds use a `-dirty` tag; they are not release images.

## PostgreSQL development environment

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.compose.example .env.compose
```

Edit the ignored `.env.compose` and replace `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` with a new random
password used **only for this local database**. Leave the distinct development
database/user defaults or set your own. The committed example is a placeholder,
not a working secret. Do not copy production database credentials into this file.
Then start the database:

```powershell
docker compose --env-file .env.compose up --detach --wait postgres
docker compose --env-file .env.compose ps
```

The service uses pinned PostgreSQL 16 Alpine, SCRAM host authentication, the named
`unicircle_postgres_data` volume, and `pg_isready` health checks. It publishes only
`127.0.0.1:55432`, so other machines cannot connect through that binding. Set
`POSTGRES_PORT` if that port is occupied. Existing host/project databases are not
changed. PostgreSQL-only startup leaves an empty database; full-stack startup
applies reviewed migrations, while feature seeds remain explicit.

Connection hosts depend on where the client runs:

| Client                                                   | Database host          | Port                         |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Backend running natively on this laptop                  | `127.0.0.1`            | `55432` (or `POSTGRES_PORT`) |
| Separate Docker Desktop backend using the published port | `host.docker.internal` | `55432`                      |
| Backend/migrate sharing the Compose database network     | `postgres`             | `5432`                       |

Use `postgresql+psycopg://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE` for the backend's
runtime `DATABASE_URL`, with the matching values from `.env.compose`. URL-encode
reserved characters in username/password. Do not set this URL in frontend
environment files. For a local-only random password without URI delimiters:

```powershell
[guid]::NewGuid().ToString('N')
```

The backend container's default startup waits for an authenticated database
query before starting Uvicorn, with bounded retries and safe logs. Configure
`DATABASE_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` and `DATABASE_STARTUP_RETRY_SECONDS` at runtime
if needed. A standalone `python -m app.db.wait` command is available in the image.
Database readiness does not replace schema migrations. Compose
backend dependency wiring uses `condition: service_healthy`, following
[Docker's startup-order guidance](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/startup-order/).

Stop the database while preserving its data:

```powershell
docker compose --env-file .env.compose down
```

Normal shutdown/removal preserves the named volume. Do not add `--volumes`
unless you explicitly intend to erase this local database. Changing the initial
username/password/database environment values does not modify an already
initialized volume; use PostgreSQL administration to change credentials.
The development database account is not a production account. Production needs
separate runtime secrets, permissions, backups, and a reviewed hosting topology.

## Images and repeatable verification

```powershell
$env:IMAGE_TAG = (git rev-parse --short=12 HEAD).Trim()
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/build_docker.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File backend/scripts/verify_docker.ps1 -Image "unicircle-backend:$env:IMAGE_TAG"
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify_postgres_docker.ps1 -BackendImage "unicircle-backend:$env:IMAGE_TAG"
```

The PostgreSQL check uses a unique temporary Compose project, random test
credentials, and a random loopback port. It verifies database health, rejected
bad passwords, named-volume persistence after container recreation, backend
waiting while PostgreSQL is stopped, recovery when it starts, and graceful API
shutdown. It removes only its own test containers/network/volume in `finally`,
then restores process environment values. Real project data is never used.

Frontend runtime and desktop/mobile browser-check commands are in
[frontend/README.md](../../frontend/README.md); backend runtime, readiness,
migration, and seed commands are in [backend/README.md](../../backend/README.md).

## Compose flow verification

After building images, install local frontend dev dependencies (`npm ci` in
`frontend/`, supported Node 20.19+ or 22) and run:

```powershell
node frontend/scripts/verify_compose.mjs IMAGE_TAG
```

This creates a random, isolated Compose project and a new DB named
`unicircle_compose_smoke`. It runs actual production images and migrations,
then inserts synthetic verified accounts with a fixture that refuses any other
database or a database already containing accounts. No auth dependencies are
overridden. The test-only `compose.test.yaml` overlay mounts a capture-only SMTP
fixture with a temporary trusted certificate, TLS and authentication. It checks
real registration, received OTP verification, rejection before verification,
browser login/cookies, scoped club/event actions,
registration/interest/membership, resources and private chat, forum moderation,
news and notifications, transport management, desktop/mobile pages, persistence
after app recreation, logout, and graceful shutdown. The fixture is not shipped
in images. Test containers, networks, and the temporary DB volume are removed
in `finally`; normal project volumes remain untouched.

The suite never sends external email or calls your model. Temporary test-only
mail/certificate artifacts and screenshots stay under ignored `tmp/`. The
existing auth/OTP and RAG tests cover their contracts/failures; actual provider
delivery, populated-corpus ingestion and model reachability need separate
environment acceptance checks. The Docker suite verifies the empty-index
assistant fallback, not model inference quality. Never load `compose.test.yaml`
with the normal stack or a populated database.

An optional third argument tests another checkout with the existing installed
test tooling: `node frontend/scripts/verify_compose.mjs IMAGE_TAG ABSOLUTE_CLONE_PATH`.
The checkout must contain the committed Compose files and fixtures; no native
environment files, database data, or virtual environment are needed in it.

## Production preparation and security review

Both app images use digest-pinned bases, locked production dependencies,
root-owned application files, non-root accounts, and exec-form startup. Frontend
runtime excludes npm/npx, Corepack, Yarn, development dependencies and host
environment files. A pinned available Debian patch is applied during its build;
the Python base was refreshed to the patched immutable digest. Version/revision
OCI labels and commit-SHA/release tags identify the source. Keep base digests,
lockfiles and scanner data under review; pinning does not mean vulnerability-free.

Compose runs frontend, backend, migrations **and PostgreSQL** as non-root,
with read-only roots, dropped capabilities, no-new-privileges and bounded PIDs.
Only PostgreSQL's data volume is persistent/writable; `/tmp`, its socket directory,
and frontend image cache are bounded tmpfs mounts. The pinned Alpine PostgreSQL
image uses UID/GID 70. Verify ownership before attaching externally created or
restored data; never solve permission errors by deleting a populated volume.
App logs go to stdout/stderr; rotated Docker logs are limited to 3 × 10 MB per
container. `init: true` forwards signals for the app containers, with 30-second
shutdown grace. Next.js and Uvicorn may exit 143 after SIGTERM cleanup when
running under init (or 0); the API must log completed application shutdown.
Liveness does not prove SMTP, RAG or every schema invariant.

The preparation overlay removes the PostgreSQL host port and requires a reviewed
image tag. Supply **separate production credentials**, an HTTPS frontend URL and
a private model endpoint; use the hosting provider's secret management and
review backup/restore, resource limits and network policy before deployment:

```powershell
docker compose --env-file .env.production -f compose.yaml -f compose.production.yaml up --detach --no-build --wait
```

`.env.production` is ignored; the command is documentation, not an automatic
deployment. The frontend remains loopback-bound, intended for a reviewed HTTPS
reverse proxy/ingress. Production hosting, managed database, TLS and CI/CD are
later phases, not silently selected here.

Run the release security gate:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/scan_docker.ps1 -Version IMAGE_TAG
```

The scanner is pinned to an immutable [Trivy 0.75.0 release](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy/releases/tag/v0.75.0).
It scans exported image archives, not your Docker socket, secrets or DB volumes,
using [Trivy's archive-input support](https://trivy.dev/docs/dev/references/configuration/cli/trivy_image/).
Reports are retained under ignored `tmp/docker-security/reports/`; generated
archives are removed afterward. Scanner DB cache is a reusable Docker volume
under Docker Desktop's configured data location. High/critical findings fail the
gate, including unfixed findings; nothing is automatically suppressed.
See [SECURITY_REVIEW.md](SECURITY_REVIEW.md) for current findings and limitations.
