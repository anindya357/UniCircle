# UniCircle

UniCircle is a smart digital campus platform for Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology (CUET). It will bring campus information, clubs and events, resource sharing, transport, community discussions, announcements, notifications, and a campus-focused AI assistant into one application.

## Current status

The project is being implemented incrementally from the approved project context and feature-wise plan. The current repository foundation separates the Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, documentation, scripts, and deployment assets so each layer can evolve without mixing responsibilities.

## Planned technology stack

- Frontend: Next.js, React, and TypeScript
- Backend: FastAPI and Python
- Database: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy and Alembic
- Authentication: JWT and email OTP verification
- AI assistant: LangChain-based retrieval-augmented generation
- Delivery: Docker, Docker Compose, and GitHub Actions

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20.19 or newer and npm
- Python 3.12 or newer
- PostgreSQL 17 or compatible server
- Git

## Local setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for the future full-stack runtime. Never commit `.env`.
3. Copy `frontend/.env.example` to `frontend/.env.local` for the browser-safe frontend configuration.
4. Install and run the frontend:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open `http://localhost:3000`.

The backend setup, local PostgreSQL role/database, and migration commands are in
[backend/README.md](./backend/README.md). Full-stack Docker commands will be
documented in the Dockerization phase.

## Quality checks

From `frontend/`, run:

```bash
npm run format:check
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

From `backend/`, after installing `.[dev]`, run:

```bash
python -m pytest
python -m ruff check app tests migrations
python -m ruff format --check app tests migrations
```

## Security

Do not commit real passwords, tokens, OTP values, database credentials, SMTP credentials, or AI-provider keys. Browser-visible variables must use the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix and must never contain secrets.
