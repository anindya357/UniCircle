# Continuous integration

[`ci.yml`](ci.yml) runs on pull requests targeting `main`, pushes to `main`,
and manual **Actions → CI → Run workflow** requests. Superseded runs for the
same branch/PR are cancelled. This is CI only; Phase 12 deployment is not enabled.

| Check | What must pass |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend checks | Locked npm install, ESLint (zero warnings), TypeScript, Vitest unit/component tests, Next.js production build |
| Backend checks | Hash-locked runtime install, pinned test tools, Ruff lint/format, knowledge-base validation, all unit/in-process API tests, Alembic upgrade, PostgreSQL HTTP/API tests |
| Docker (backend/frontend) | Both production Dockerfiles build, runtime user is non-root; backend includes valid curated knowledge files |
| CI gate | All of the above succeeded; failure, cancellation or skipped prerequisites cannot pass |

## Database and external services

The backend job creates a disposable PostgreSQL 16 service named `unicircle_ci`.
Its published credentials are test-only, not application credentials. Integration
tests explicitly require `CI_TEST_DATABASE_URL`, migrate a separate randomly
named schema for each test, and remove only that schema afterwards. The tests
exercise registration/OTP/login/logout/profile, student email domains, real JWT
authorization, news publication and persisted notifications. Every HTTP request
uses a fresh database session. Existing feature tests additionally cover the
other modules with isolated SQLite databases and fake external services.

SMTP and LLM calls are faked; CI does not send email, crawl CUET, download model
weights, access the development database or need a running Ollama server.
Without `CI_TEST_DATABASE_URL`, PostgreSQL-specific tests skip locally. If it
is supplied but wrong or unreachable, they fail rather than silently falling
back to a different database.

## Reports and troubleshooting

Open the failing job in [Actions](https://github.com/anindya357/UniCircle/actions).
JUnit XML reports are uploaded as `frontend-tests` and `backend-tests`, including
when a test fails, and kept for seven days. Build output stays in job logs;
images are neither pushed to a registry nor deployed.

Reproduce frontend checks from `frontend`:

```powershell
npm ci
npm run lint -- --max-warnings=0
npm run typecheck
npm run test:unit
npm run build
```

Reproduce backend checks from `backend` using the project's Python 3.12 venv:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -r requirements-ci.txt
.\.venv\Scripts\ruff check app tests scripts
.\.venv\Scripts\ruff format --check app tests scripts
.\.venv\Scripts\python -m app.modules.assistant.ingest --check
.\.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest -m 'not integration' --strict-markers
```

To run PostgreSQL tests, explicitly set `CI_TEST_DATABASE_URL` to a **disposable**
local PostgreSQL database named `unicircle_ci`, then run
`python -m pytest -m integration --strict-markers`. Never use the project's real
database or production credentials for this purpose.

## Main branch policy and security

Protect `main` with the stable **CI gate** check, require the branch to be
up-to-date, require one approving review and dismiss stale approvals. Preserve
the repository owner's existing administrator bypass for the requested direct
`main` workflow; contributors' PR merges require review and passing CI. Admin
bypass means an owner can still push directly before CI finishes, so a green
run on the pushed commit should be confirmed before release.

Actions use immutable commit pins, checkout does not persist Git credentials,
and the workflow grants only `contents: read`. No repository/environment
secrets are referenced. Untrusted code runs using `pull_request`, never
`pull_request_target`, and cannot deploy or publish images. Docker build-cache
writes are enabled only on pushes to the trusted `main` branch. Dependency and
image security scans and coverage reports remain optional future additions;
existing Phase 10 security-review/deployment prerequisites are not bypassed.
